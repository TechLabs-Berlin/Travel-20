Coronavirus has an unprecedented impact on the world. It has shifted our perspective on everyday life, our priorities and sent many of us into a state of isolation. In order to protect our loved ones and ourselves, we choose to refrain from travelling to see them. 
This project has a very personal meaning for all of us working on Travel 21. We all are expats stranded in different locations, wondering every day when it will be possible and safe to see our family and friends. 
That’s our motivation  to find a solution to safely travel without increasing the number of cases and without breaking the imposed restrictions. 
We do not encourage travelling in pandemic times. Our wish is to offer an accessible picture and by doing so, for people to understand the context of the situation and minimize risks when deciding to take a trip. This also means that in many cases not travelling might be the conclusion drawn from our platform.
Travel 21 aims to simplify the research for travel restrictions and recommendations by creating a platform to more easily access the most crucial data you’ll need in order to make important travel decisions. 
But bear in mind: Restrictions change quite easily and so do numbers – this is not an exact science and we are no medical or political experts. What we are doing every day is to collect information from different, reliable sources, analyse and verify it. However, we ask you kindly to double-check our travel recommendations with the local authorities and to not travel if it is not necessary. 
Stay healthy, safe and informed!
Your Travel 21 Team.
